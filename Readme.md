# Eleventy Javascript Template Literals plugin

JSTL is back in Eleventy! Sort of. Uses [xhtm](https://github.com/dy/xhtm) and [@small-tech/hyperscript-to-html-string](https://codeberg.org/small-tech/hyperscript-to-html-string) to give you back simple templates without having to learn arcane syntax.

ADD SCREENSHOT

## Motivation behind this project

- No arcane syntax to remember, it's all `${literals}`
- No custom DSL for filters / looping / statements, it's all Javascript
- Less boilerplate than JS templates
- Support for components

## Known issues

- No windows support
